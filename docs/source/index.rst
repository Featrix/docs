Welcome to Featrix!
===================

`**Featrix** <https://featrix.ai/>` is a data gateway to create ML models for structured data *with no data preparation on your part*. Featrix comes with a Python client library for ML engineers and data scientists to work with any structured data source, including Pandas dataframe objects. Featrix is powered by a hosted SaaS or private Docker containers deployed on site in private clouds with an enterprise license.

Featrix works by creating a vector space and encoding your data into embeddings in the vector space. You can train multiple downstream models within a single vector space; you can encode data from multiple sources into a single vector space, and you can further fine-tune the models for specific tasks downstream.

Featrix gives you an out-of-the-box ML-ready platform to build applications with minimal data preparation overhead, so you can quickly explore the predictive value of new data sets, operate ML at scale, and enable statistically rich models with minimal human work in the loop for both test and production environments.

    Featrix is currently in private beta with select customers.
