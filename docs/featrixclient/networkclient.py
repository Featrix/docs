        Parameters
        ----------
        url : str
            The url of the Featrix server you are using.

            The default is http://embedding.featrix.com:8080

    def EZ_NewVectorSpace(self, df: pd.DataFrame):
        """
        Create a new vector space on a dataframe. The dataframe should include all target columns that you might want to predict.

        You do not need to clean nulls or make the data numeric; pass in strings or missing values all that you need to.

        You can pass in timestamps as a string in a variety of formats (ctime, ISO 8601, etc) and Featrix will detect and extract features as appropriate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df : pd.DataFrame
            The dataframe with both the input and target values.
            This can be the same as the dataframe used to train models in vector space.

        Returns
        -------
        str uuid of the vector space (which we call vector_space_id on other calls)

        Notes
        -----
        This call blocks until training has completed; the lower level API gives you more async control.

        To combine a series and dataframe, do something like:
 
        .. hightlight:: python
        .. code-block:: python
            
            all_df = df.copy() # call .copy() if you do not want to change the original.
