        label : str

        on_bad_lines: str
            this is passed to pandas pd.read_csv without editing. 'skip' will ignore the bad lines; 'error' will stop loading and fail if there are bad lines. In the current software, passing 'warn' will not get returned to the API client (we need to fix this).

        sample_percentage: float.

        Notes
        -----
        Files are compared with a local md5 hash and a remote md5 hash before deciding to transmit the file.

        File hashes happen on the entire file; the data file is not sampled or de-duplicated prior to training a vector
        space. In other words, the sampling and de-duplication parameters are intended for convenience and not to save
        bandwidth or storage. We are open to feedback on this behavior. One implication is that samples will vary across
        trainings.

    def EZ_DataSpaceAutoJoin(self, data_space_id: str):

        Computes auto joining possibilities for the specified data space.

        This lets us investigate the linking performed with `EZ_DataSpaceNewVectorSpace()` so that we
        can review it and tweak it if needed. The resulting dictionaries can be modified and passed to
        `EZ_DataSpaceNewVectorSpace` for training. You can also pass the mappings to `EZ_DataSpaceDoProjection`
        to see example projections from the mappings.

        There are two goals with the mappings:

        First, we want to map fields that uniquely identify objects to whatever degree we can.

        Second, we want to map mutual information that spans data sets so that those fields
        get input into the same place in our input vectors to the embeddings transformation.

        We infer the second set of mappings by leveraging the first set to identify linked records
        and then we sample and look for high conditional probabilities of fields resulting in the
        same field. For example, in this dataset, the joint distribution of unrelated fields often
        looks promising, such as when comparing "building square feet" and "street number" from
        different tables. But when we condition this comparison to specific linked entities,
        those unrelated false positives no longer hold and we latch onto the "correct" associations,
        such as zip code information across different source files, even if their unconditioned
        mutual information was "closer".

        This feature is in beta.

        This can be used to confirm there are statistical relationships that are clearly
        present in the various files associated. This serves to diagnose and verify behavior
        before training the vector space on the data.

        You can also get back a CSV file of the projection to examine before creating
        the vector space.

        The linkage includes a list of the full columns in the result.

        Create a multimodal vector space on data space.

        This lets you create multimodal embeddings for assorted tabular data sources in a single
        trained vector space. This essentially lets you build a foundational model on your data
        in such a way that you can query the entire data by using partial information that maps into
        as little as one of your original data sources, or you can leverage partial information
        spanning multiple data sources.

        You can create multiple vector spaces from a data space; you can use a subset of the data,
        ignore columns, or change mappings to rapidly experiment with models using this call.

        The data space must already be loaded with 1 or more data source files.

        This function will use auto-join (which you can try directly with `EZ_DataSpaceAutoJoin`)
        to find the linkage and corresponding overlapping mutual information between data files
        that have been loaded. Then a new vector space is trained with the following columns:

            Base data file: all columns (unless ignored in the ignore_cols parameter)

            2nd data file:  all columns, renamed to <2nd data file label> + "_" + <original_col_name>
                            However, the columns used for linking will not be present, as they
                            will get their mapped names in the base data file.

                            To ignore a column in the 2nd data file, specify the name in the
                            transformed format.

            3rd data file:  same as 2nd data file.

        This trains the vector space in the following manner:

            Let's imagine the 2nd_file_col1 and 3rd_file_col2 are the linkage to col1 in the base
            data set. The training space will effectively be a sparse matrix:

                col1                    col2          col3        2nd_file_col2       2nd_file_col3       3rd_file_col2

        ----------
        data_space_id: str
            the id returned from `EZ_DataSpaceCreate`

        vector_name: str
            You can specify your own name for the vector space, or Featrix will assign one for you.

        metadata: dict
            Your own dictionary of metadata if you want to track version information or other characteristics.

        ignore_cols:
            A list of columns you want to ignore. You can get the list of columns, which may include renamed columns
            from merging multiple files, by calling detect_only=True

        detect_only:
            If set to True, Featrix will not create the vector space, but instead it will construct the mapping links,
            detect data types and encoders, identify opportunities for enrichment, and return all of this information
            to you.

        mapping:
            By default, Featrix will establish links between files in the data space and use these links to construct
            the mapping for the vector space. If Featrix cannot automatically map the data, an error will be returned.
            You can override the Featrix mapping behavior using this parameter to pass a dictionary of mappings.

            This dict is in the format returned by `EZ_DataSpaceAutoJoin`.

        df : pd.DataFrame | list[pd.DataFrame]
            The dataframe with both the input and target values. This can be the same as the dataframe

            If `check_accuracy` is set to true, this will just ensure that the highest probability is right; we do not
